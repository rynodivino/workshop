Created the project before I knew what tutorial it would actually house.

### Let's Learn How to Code a Binary Search Tree in Javascript!
-------------------------------------------------------------
This is not a super easy beginner tutorial (at this point).  Most of the solutions are based on 
blogposts I read at http://www.nczonline.net, the *Computer Science in Javascript* series (which I highly recommend). 

### What is a Binary Tree?
---------------------------
Basically it's a data structure consiting of at least a root node.  Each node can have up to two leaves (one going right, and one going left).  One child must be less than the parent, and one must be greater than the parent (this is what seperates this structure from say a linked list - which can have aribitrary values).
For more on binary tree's, check out the wiki page:
