This is the first program in a series to create a binary search tree.

Let's keep the first step simple.  Create a function "BinarySearchTree",
that upon construction creates a root node internally, and gives it a
null value;


----------------------------------------------------------------------
HINTS:

To make Node.js program, create a new file with a `.js` extension and
start writing JavaScript! Execute your program by running it with the
`node` command. e.g.:

  $ node myprogram.js

  You can write to the console in the same way as in the browser:
    
        console.log(tree.rootNode); // should output null

      When you are done, you must run:

         {appname} verify myprogram.js

         to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated,
         and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
